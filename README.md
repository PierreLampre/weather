A simple SPA I built that retrieves weather data from OpenWeatherAPI.  When the user enters a zipcode into the text input and clicks Submit, weather data for that area it shown in the UI.  

This project used create-react-app and react-dotenv.  

This project was a great way for me to get a deeper understanding of React Hooks, specifically the useState hook.
